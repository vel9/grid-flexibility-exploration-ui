## Grid Exploration UI

This portfolio project is the front-end UI for [Grid Exploration API](https://github.com/vel9/grid-flexibility-exploration-api)

It's an interactive version of "Resources Scheduled Day Ahead" chart of my data exploration [here](https://github.com/vel9/grid-flexibility-exploration/blob/main/HomeGridFlexibility.ipynb) - inspired by the flexible load profile discussion in Saul Griffith's *Electrify* (p.89).

The React UI is bootstrapped with the [React + Vite template](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) and makes requests to the above API. It displays data with Plotly, provides form validations and general error-handling for communicating with the backend.
